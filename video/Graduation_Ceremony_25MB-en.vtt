7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.950
In my life, I wanted to see so much, give so much, do so much, and believe in tomorrow

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.950
Why not play the hero of a book that goes far, that loses its way

9

Hair in the wind, I will cross all the seas

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.950
Without any regret, without baggage and with a heart of stone

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.950
I will shout from the rooftops of the world, to the endless horizon of my dreams

That life is made only to be the one I describe in my poems

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.950
Don’t cry, I have no trouble, just enough to make my life

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.950
As long as four stars light the way of the first

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.150
I will journey to the farthest reaches of the earth, and pursue the endless horizon of my dreams

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.950
I do not flee, I leave, I run, I fall, I fly and go toward my destiny

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.950
As if my heart could not stay still in this uncertain world

23
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.950
