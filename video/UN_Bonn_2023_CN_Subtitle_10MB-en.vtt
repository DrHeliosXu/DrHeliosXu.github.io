(Live) Public Speech at UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn

2
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.000
Welcome to today's session (Moderator Dr. Xu)

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.160
So on the topic of Chinese energy transition and technology innovation, we

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
find ourselves like in the middle of an era where both the

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.120
urgency of combating climate change and the need for technology advancements.

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.200
So China stands in the forefront of this challenge due to huge

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.940
population and also huge energy consumption.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.920
Fast forward 10 years to today, so China has emerged as a

9
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.280
global leader in solar power deployment and it claimed the largest market

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.640
and for the battery-powered electric vehicles.

11
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.600
So committed to a decarbonized industrial upgrades, China has recognized hydrogen as

12
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.880
an essential energy resource rather than hazardous chemicals.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.020
So this has been a significant shift that already noted in its

14
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060
national energy law draft of 2020.

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.620
So as announced also in the latest 14th five-year development plan,

16
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.620
China has taken extraordinary steps with substantial investment in clean hydrogen technologies

17
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.280
to foster a sustainable hydrogen economy and also further to achieve its

18
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.260
commitment to carbon neutrality by 2016.

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420
So across the continents, another chapter unfolds.

20
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.200
Europe is renowned for its long-term commitment in sustainability and tremendous

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.040
actions in climate change.

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.280
And also Europe indeed has embraced clean energy technologies wholeheartedly since last

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.700
century.

24
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
Ambitious initiatives like European Clean Hydrogen Alliance and also the Repower EU

25
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.820
plan are fueling innovation and fostering global collaboration.

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.040
The European Hydrogen Bank announced by the European Union in 2022 with

27
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.200
an initial funding of 3 billion euros.

28
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.800
So the bank aims to boost the European hydrogen market to a

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.560
brand new level.

30
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.440
Nations like Germany, Netherlands and France, they are also making significant investment

31
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.000
in hydrogen infrastructure, pushing the boundaries of clean energy adoption.

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.240
Digital sustainability, the marriage of digitization and sustainability.

33
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.460
So it holds immense promise for our journey towards a sustainable future.

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.940
The power of digital sustainability, such as a rising new star, everyone

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.080
knows, chatGBT, blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things is revolutionizing

36
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680
how we produce, distribute and consume energy.

37
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.460
These technologies enable us to optimize energy systems, improve efficiency and enhance

38
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.340
the integration of renewable energy resources.

39
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.160
Let's imagine a world where the energy systems are smart, interconnected and

40
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.700
responsive.

41
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.740
Buildings and cities become like energy hubs, generating and sharing electricity, heat

42
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.820
and even hydrogen.

43
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.780
So renewable energy sources are seamlessly integrated into the grid, creating a

44
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.480
decentralized and resilient energy network.

45
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.320
By embracing clean energy technologies such as hydrogen and leveraging the power

46
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.080
of digital sustainability, we process the tools already and to drive this

47
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.860
transition forward.

48
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.580
So governments, industrial leaders and researchers, we must collaborate on a global

49
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.100
stage and to develop innovation solutions and forging a path towards a

50
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.920
world powered by clean energy and driven by digital sustainability.

51
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.680
