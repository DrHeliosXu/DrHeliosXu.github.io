00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.999
All right, welcome
to the Deep Dive.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.769
Today, we're going to
be taking a look at

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.199
the really impressive
career of Dr. Hong Xu.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.819
Sounds good.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.249
So, you know, we got
a bunch of mercurials

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.979
to work with here.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.629
His CV, which is really
detailed and covers

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.379
a lot of ground.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.769
And we also have some
additional info about,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.368

and some of the big things

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.179
he's been involved with.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.068
Yeah, and I think the
idea here is, you know,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.459
it's not just like a
standard biography.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.969
It's more like, you know, a
case study, especially for,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.368
like, young students, young
professionals, people who are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.049
really excited about the idea
of, you know, contributing

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.829
to a cleaner energy future,
a greener energy future,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.239
a future with, you know,
better energy security.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.299
I think Dr. Yu's career
path has a lot to teach us.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.099
For sure.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.869
I mean, if you think about
it, energy has always been,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.859
like, this fundamental
thing for human progress.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.309
I mean, going back to, like,
the earliest ways of making

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.349
fire, right, to all the
kind of amazing renewable

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.079
energy technologies
we're seeing today.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.999
And even, like, looking
forward to the future of fuel.
