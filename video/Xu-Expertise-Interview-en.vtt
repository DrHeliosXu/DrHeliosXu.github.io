Welcome to the DeepDive Podcast! 

1
00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.760
All right. Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today, we're going to be taking a look at

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.180
the really impressive career of Dr. Hong Xu.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.820
Sounds good.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.980
So, you know, we got a bunch of materials to work with here.

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.380
His CV, which is really detailed and covers a lot of ground.

6
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.760
And we also have some additional info about,

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.180
like, his specific expertise and some of the big things he's been involved with.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.560
Yeah. And I think the idea here is, you know, it's not just like a standard biography.

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.940
It's more like, you know, a case study,

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.740
especially for, like, young students, young professionals,

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.000
people who are really excited about the idea of,

12
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.720
you know, contributing to a cleaner energy future, a greener energy future,

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.240
a future with, you know, better energy security.

14
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.320
I think Dr. Xu's career path has a lot to teach us.

15
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.940
For sure. I mean, if you think about it, energy has always been, like,

16
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.880
this fundamental thing for human progress.

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.960
I mean, going back to, like, the earliest ways of making fire, right?

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.100
The kind of amazing renewable energy technologies we're seeing today.

19
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480
And even, like, looking forward to the future of fusion.

20
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.860
So, you know, our goal for today is to really dive into his experiences

21
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.680
and kind of pull out the key takeaways and, you know, see how his work

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.860
is connected to some of these big global challenges that we're facing.

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.420
And specifically, I'm thinking about how, you know,

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760
his achievements line up with those UN Sustainable Development Goals,

25
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.800
like SDG 7, which is all about affordable and clean energy.

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.240
SDG 9, you know, focused on industry, innovation, and infrastructure.

27
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.500
And, of course, SDG 13, climate action.

28
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
Okay, so why don't we start off by looking at, like, his early foundations.

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.760
Sounds great.

30
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.980
You know, where did this all begin?

31
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.780
So, yeah, his academic journey, it all started with this, like,

32
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.100
really strong focus on the core science of renewable energy.

33
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.440
Yeah.

34
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.880
So from 2009 to 2013, he was working on his bachelor's degree

35
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.800
in materials chemistry, and he did this at Beijing Transport University.

36
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.320
Okay.

37
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.580
And what's interesting is he specialized in solar cells and batteries, which,

38
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.260
I mean, that's like the building blocks of a lot of our renewable energy infrastructure.

39
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.680
And, you know, I mean, his GPA was excellent.

40
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.720
He graduated with the highest distinction for his thesis.

41
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.240
So this early, you know, deep dive into material science,

42
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.840
I think that's a really strong base to start from.

43
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.700
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like he was, like,

44
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.220
setting himself up for success right from the start.

45
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.680
Totally.

46
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.600
And, you know, even at this early stage,

47
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.820
we start to see hints of this, like, really innovative thinking

48
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.180
that that would become a theme in his career.

49
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.760
Okay.

50
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.640
So back in 2013, he actually secured a patent in China

51
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.620
for a gas-liquid magnetic separation device.

52
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.340
Interesting.

53
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.980
Yeah, so it's not, you know, directly solar cells or batteries,

54
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.140
but it shows this early ability to, like, spot problems

55
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.200
and then engineer creative solutions.

56
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.460
And that is crucial, right?

57
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.520
In any field where you're trying to innovate.

58
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.100
Absolutely.

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.160
I mean, you got to be able to see those problems

60
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.020
and figure out, you know, creative ways to solve them.

61
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.440
Right.

62
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.920
So after that, he headed to Germany for his master's.

63
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.220
Okay.

64
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.040
So from 2014 to 2016,

65
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.000
he was working on his master's in geomaterials

66
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.120
at the Technical University of Munich, or TUM.

67
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.920
And he specialized in semiconductors.

68
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.280
Okay.

69
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.940
Now, semiconductors are super important

70
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.680
for so many different energy technologies.

71
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.260
Like, you know, you've got solar power,

72
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.720
you've got the advanced electronics you need to manage energy.

73
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.140
So it's a key area.

74
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.240
And again, he just excelled academically,

75
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.260
graduated with merit and amazing GPA.

76
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.500
And once again, his thesis was top-notch.

77
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.460
So basically a pattern here.

78
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.980
I mean, this guy is, like, consistently crushing it academically.

79
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.340
Right.

80
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.800
Like, this serious dedication to mastering

81
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.480
these complex technical topics.

82
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.040
And, you know, you need that foundation

83
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.060
if you're going to push boundaries later on.

84
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.340
Totally.

85
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.280
Okay, so we've got these, like,

86
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.580
two really impressive academic foundations in place now.

87
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.440
What was next?

88
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.220
Well, next up was the PhD.

89
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.100
The PhD.

90
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.100
At ETH Zurich.

91
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.940
Ah, ETH Zurich.

92
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.600
I mean, come on, that's like a research powerhouse.

93
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.940
Right.

94
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.540
So I'm guessing this was a pretty productive period for him.

95
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.120
Oh, absolutely.

96
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.240
This was from 2017 to 2021.

97
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.300
And he was just, you know, cranking out impactful work.

98
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.000
He got involved in projects with Toyota, for example.

99
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.000
Got funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the SNF,

100
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.079
which is a huge deal in Switzerland.

101
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.459
Yeah.

102
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.780
And he was awarded an ECS travel grant,

103
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.040
which shows that, like, internationally,

104
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.200
people were starting to recognize the importance of his research.

105
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.080
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like even at this early stage,

106
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.000
he was already making a name for himself.

107
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.420
Totally.

108
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560
And working with Toyota, I mean, that's huge.

109
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.120
That kind of industry exposure during a PhD,

110
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.640
that must have been so valuable, right?

111
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.080
It is.

112
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.360
I mean, it's one thing to be doing the work in a lab,

113
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.140
but to have that real world context.

114
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.540
Yeah.

115
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.940
To see how industry is approaching these problems, that's huge.

116
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.360
Absolutely.

117
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.180
So what was his doctoral research focused on?

118
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.720
So his research, he was doing it in cooperation with Toyota

119
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.440
and the Paul Scherer Institute.

120
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.360
They call it PSI.

121
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.940
It's a big multidisciplinary research institute in Switzerland.

122
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.520
And his project, it was a four-year project,

123
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.680
focused on hydrogen fuel cell water management.

124
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.520
Hydrogen fuel cell water management.

125
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.040
Yeah.

126
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.420
So after that, he moved into a two-year collaboration directly with Toyota,

127
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.780
working on developing fuel cell vehicles, or FCVs.

128
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.940
So right in the thick of, like, clean transportation.

129
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.760
Exactly.

130
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.440
And this is where it ties in with, you know,

131
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.760
SDG 7, clean energy, and SDG 9, industry and innovation.

132
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.680
Now, you might be wondering,

133
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.680
why is water management such a big deal when it comes to fuel cells?

134
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.380
Yeah, I was kind of wondering about that.

135
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.360
So basically, to make these fuel cells work efficiently,

136
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.800
and to make them last,

137
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.920
you need to get rid of the water that's produced during the process.

138
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.820
Interesting, okay.

139
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.360
Like, it's really crucial for their performance and their lifespan.

140
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.580
So he was working on a really specific,

141
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.260
but, like, really important challenge within the clean transportation sector.

142
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.900
Absolutely.

143
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.120
And it wasn't just about his own research either.

144
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240
He was leading teams, you know, engineers, students,

145
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.020
conducting over 20 scientific campaigns at the Swiss light source.

146
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.380
Wow.

147
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.300
Which, you know, these are intense experiments,

148
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.840
often running nonstop for 48 hours.

149
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.420
48 hours.

150
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.480
They were really pushing the limits of what we call materials dynamic research,

151
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.660
where you're looking at how materials behave and change

152
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.420
when they're actually being used.

153
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.600
So this shows, you know, not just his technical chops,

155
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.280
but also his ability to lead and manage these big, complex projects.

156
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.700
Totally. I mean, 48-hour experiments, that's, like, hardcore dedication.

157
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.280
Right, and you need real organizational skills to pull that off.

158
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.660
Definitely.

159
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.440
So what came out of all of this, like, all this research?

160
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.040
Well, he was publishing, like, crazy 11 papers, six of them,

161
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.200
where he was the lead author.

162
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.480
And he was invited to speak at a major international conference in the U.S.

163
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.860
Impressive.

164
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.520
Yeah, this is a guy who's making a real contribution

165
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.360
to the scientific knowledge in his field.

166
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.860
Absolutely.

167
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.880
And, you know, what's interesting is his CV also mentions

168
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.360
that he was pursuing a part-time MBA during his PhD.

169
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.160
I mean, that's a lot to juggle.

170
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.060
It is. It's super ambitious.

171
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.980
But I think it shows that he understood, like, even early on,

172
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.560
that the business side of innovation is really important.

173
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.960
Like, getting that MBA at the Quantic School of Business

174
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.160
while he's also doing this intense PhD, I think that's super forward-thinking.

175
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.700
It is.

176
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.000
Because, you know, it's one thing to invent cool new technologies,

177
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.220
but to actually make a difference,

178
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.980
you've got to be able to translate them into products and services

179
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.320
that work in the real world.

180
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.200
It's that bridge between, you know, the lab and the market, right?

181
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.940
Exactly. Like, you need both.

182
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.160
And this kind of dual focus, it's incredibly valuable,

183
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.200
especially if you're someone who wants to

184
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.040
not just invent clean energy solutions,

185
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.840
but actually get them out there and make a real impact.

186
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.360
I mean, it really speaks to his vision.

187
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.940
It does.

188
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.700
So, okay, that covers his, like, really intense academic

189
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.520
and early research phase.

190
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.800
What happened after ETH Zurich?

191
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.960
Well, after that, his expertise kind of branched out

192
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.440
in some really interesting directions.

193
00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.820
Okay.

194
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.940
And, you know, we can actually see hints of this interdisciplinary approach,

195
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.120
even in his earlier work.

196
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.580
Like, he had a role as a modeling trainee at the École des Ponds ParisTech,

197
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.860
focusing on water environment modeling.

198
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.180
Which, you know, it's different, but it's related to his other work.

199
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.480
Yeah.

200
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.480
And he also did a summer internship at the European FEL,

201
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.860
which is this massive research facility,

202
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.640
working on materials imaging setup.

203
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.140
Wow.

204
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.920
And then he had a working student position at Infineon,

205
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.419
where he was dealing with chip quality and control.

206
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.200
So, like, a lot of different experiences.

207
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.320
Like, real mix.

208
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.940
And I think what they all have in common

209
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.260
is they exposed him to different research methods,

210
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.760
different technological challenges.

211
00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:42.460
Yeah.

212
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.300
I mean, it sounds like he was really actively seeking out opportunities

213
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.180
to learn from all these different fields.

214
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.700
Totally.

215
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.760
And that's a great takeaway, you know,

216
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.920
especially for someone who might be super focused on one specific area.

217
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.340
Yeah.

218
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.880
It's good to remember that there's value in exploring these related disciplines.

219
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.660
Absolutely.

220
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.260
This kind of broadening of his experience, it continued after his PhD.

221
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.140
Oh, yeah, for sure.

222
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.560
One big step was his venture capital fellowship at Miracle Plus,

223
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.600
which used to be Y Combinator China.

224
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:09.980
Okay.

225
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.780
And this was, you know, right in the middle of all the craziness with COVID.

226
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.860
But even with all that going on,

227
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.720
he was able to identify and evaluate over 20 startups in the energy sector.

228
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.300
Wow.

229
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.820
And two of those actually made it all the way to the investment committee.

230
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.600
That's impressive.

231
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.500
I mean, talk about adapting to change.

232
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.340
And it really shows you that he can analyze,

233
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.340
like, the real commercial potential of these new energy technologies.

234
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.920
Definitely.

235
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.200
And, you know, this directly supports SDG9

236
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.640
because it's all about promoting investment in these innovative solutions.

237
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.280
So he's gone from the lab to the business world,

238
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.820
now to the world of investments.

239
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.260
Totally.

240
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.020
And then he did an equity research internship at Seatic Securities.

241
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.520
Okay.

242
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.820
And this was focused on the materials and energy sectors.

243
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.880
So he was analyzing the public listing of a major silicon industry group

244
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.200
and kind of assessing the growth potential of new materials.

245
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.400
So now he's getting into the financial side of things.

246
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.720
Yeah.

247
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.240
He's seeing how the markets work,

248
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.300
what the financial drivers are within these sectors.

249
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.460
Which is huge, right?

250
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.640
Because ultimately, for renewable energy to be widely adopted,

251
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.200
you need the financial markets to be on board.

252
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.340
You need the investment.

253
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:17.960
Exactly.

254
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.500
So, okay, he's seen the science, the business, the finance.

255
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.300
What about the bigger picture?

256
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.500
Like the policy and the kind of broader strategic stuff

257
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.880
that shapes the whole energy transition?

258
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:32.440
Right.

259
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.440
So that's where his visiting research fellowship

260
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.360
at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, or OES, comes in.

261
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.700
Okay.

262
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.460
So at OES, he was really digging into the hydrogen economy

263
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.240
and sustainable strategies in the EU and Asia.

264
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.280
Yeah.

265
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.580
So his research involved comparing different policy approaches,

266
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.060
looking at market trends,

267
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.780
and talking to experts in the industry in these key regions.

268
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.860
And this connects directly to SDG 7 and SDG 13

269
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.480
because it's all about figuring out the policy frameworks you need

270
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.640
to actually make that transition to clean energy happen.

271
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.380
Like putting all the pieces together, right?

272
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.080
You've got the technology, the business models, the investment,

273
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.220
and then you've got the policy that kind of creates the environment

274
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.260
for it all to flourish.

275
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:14.800
Right.

276
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.740
And it's amazing to see how all these seemingly different experiences

277
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.940
from the super technical details of fuel cell water management

278
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.460
to the big picture strategic thinking about international energy policy,

279
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.860
it all connects.

280
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.760
It all fits together.

281
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.160
Yeah.

282
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.020
It all contributes to a deeper, more holistic understanding

283
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.160
of the renewable energy landscape.

284
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.740
Totally.

285
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.580
And his commitment to lifelong learning, it's obvious.

286
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.380
Like his CV also mentions an executive education

287
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.440
in green transitions at Cambridge Judge Business School.

288
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:48.720
Yeah.

289
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.100
I mean, this guy's a learning machine.

290
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.580
He is.

291
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.620
And he got a Santander Bank scholarship for that and achieved a high GPA,

292
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.040
which is not surprising at this point.

293
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.340
Right.

294
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.800
Like always pushing himself.

295
00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.480
It's amazing.

296
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.540
And it just underscores that, you know, no matter how much you've already learned,

297
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.800
there's always more to learn,

298
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.100
especially in a field that's evolving as quickly as renewable energy.

299
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.320
Yeah.

300
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.360
You got to stay ahead of the curve.

301
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:08.960
You do.

302
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.040
And it looks like he was also actively contributing

303
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.280
to these broader sustainability discussions

304
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.600
through his KFAS SGS fellowship.

305
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.740
So as part of that fellowship, he worked on a few thought pieces,

306
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.680
including one called from e-waste to e-power.

307
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
From e-waste to e-power.

308
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.880
That sounds interesting.

309
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.220
Yeah.

310
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.180
It's a really important topic because it deals

311
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.280
with that whole issue of electronic waste.

312
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.620
Right.

313
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.900
And how can we take this waste and turn it into something useful like energy?

314
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.260
Yeah.

315
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.660
So it's all about thinking in terms of a circular economy,

316
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.420
not just creating clean energy,

317
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.860
but managing our resources in a sustainable way across the whole life cycle.

318
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.180
So he's thinking beyond just like generating clean energy.

319
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.540
It's about the entire system, right?

320
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.160
Exactly.

321
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.500
And speaking of making a big impact,

322
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.320
his involvement with the United Nations is like really significant.

323
00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.100
Huge.

324
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.080
So tell me about that.

325
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.420
So he's working with these UN bodies

326
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.260
and it's really connecting his expertise directly

327
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.380
to those sustainable development goals.

328
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:05.800
Okay.

329
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.220
So for example, he was part of this group of experts

330
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.160
at the UN Economic Commission for Europe.

331
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.480
And he was contributing to reports and discussions

332
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.700
within the Climate Change and Inland Transport Committee.

333
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.400
Now, this is really important

334
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.260
because it directly addresses SDG 13,

335
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.300
climate action,

336
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.000
and how it interacts with the transportation sector.

337
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.400
I mean, transport is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

338
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:30.860
It is.

339
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.800
So he's basically at the table, right?

340
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:32.960
Yeah.

341
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.300
Helping to shape policy at a really high level.

342
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:35.940
He is.

343
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.020
And he also chaired a parallel session at the UNFCCC,

344
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.380
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn.

345
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.420
And the topic was Chinese energy transition and technology innovation.

346
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.380
So he's on this global stage talking about SDG 7 and SDG 13.

347
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.240
I mean, that's a real leadership role.

348
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.800
It is.

349
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.320
Facilitating these discussions, sharing his expertise.

350
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.380
And he's doing it at this global level where it really matters.

351
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:01.940
Exactly.

352
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.080
And it's not just about current policy either.

353
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.040
He's also helping to shape the next generation of leaders in this field.

354
